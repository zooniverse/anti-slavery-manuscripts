      Tom Blake has been working at the Boston Public Library as their Digital
      Imaging Production Manager and Digital Projects Manager since 2005. He
      is currently responsible for the creation of beautiful, versatile, and
      sustainable digital objects for all BPL digital initiatives. Since 2010,

      service, and as a pilot Service Hub of the Digital Public Library of America.
      Tom has overseen the digitization of the BPL's anti-slavery manuscripts and
      will be thrilled to see them transcribed so his kids who don't know cursive
      can read them.
