                The Boston Public Library's Anti-Slavery collection-one of the largest
                and most important collections of abolitionists material in the United
                States-contains roughly 40,000 pieces of correspondence, broadsides,
                newspapers, pamphlets, books, and memorabilia from the 1830s through
                the 1870s.

                  The extensive body of correspondence records interactions among
                  leading abolitionists in the United States and Great Britain over
                  a fifty year period, thus creating an archive that comprehensively
                  documents the history of the 19-century anti-slavery movement in Boston
                  as well as abroad through the end of the American Civil War and the
                  abolition of slavery.
                </div>
                <div>
                  While the abolitionists were united in their fight against the enslavement
                  of blacks, they were not always united when it came to the question
                  of whether or not women should participate in the movement.
                </div>
                <div>
                  Women's rights also proved a dominant theme in the abolitionist movement,
                  and the deep contention surrounding this issue is reflected in the
                  correspondence. In addition, while the collection documents years of
                  concerted effort on behalf of the abolitionists to end slavery, the
                  letters also report frequently on resistance against the movement,
                  thereby providing insight into the opposition.

                In the late 1890s, the family of William Lloyd Garrison, along with
                others closely involved in the anti-slavery movement, presented the
                library with a major gathering of correspondence, documents, and other
                original material relating to the abolitionist cause from 1832 until
                after the Civil War.

                The majority of the Anti-Slavery Collection was donated to the Boston
                Public Library by the end of the 19th century by Theodore Parker, Wendell
                Phillips, and the families of such abolitionists as William Lloyd
                Garrison, the Weston sisters, Amos A. Phelps, John Bishop Estlin, and Samuel Mav.
